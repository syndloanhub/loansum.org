        <p>Loansum is the initial open source offering from SyndLoanHub, LLC. Loansum is the first open source
            library designed from scratch to accurately model syndicated bank loan cash flows and valuation. Financial
            software developers can leverage loansum software to construct or extend applications with bona fide bank
            loan support.</p>

            Native bank loan software is notoriously complex and expensive. Only a handful of software vendors model
            this product accurately with sufficient support to produce detailed cash flows with accompanying
            explanations. Many financial software systems, both commercial and proprietary, cobble together inadequate
            bank loan implementations which fail to accurately model cash flows, valuation, credit, or market risk
            exposures. Loansum was developed to establish a free and open bank loan software library around which a
            community of stakeholders could extend and improve over time. Loansum is released as Open Source Software
            under the <a

            The design and implementation of loansum is based on <a

                target=_blank">Strata</a>, the award-winning open source analytics and market risk library from <a
                href="http://opengamma.com"
                target=_blank">OpenGamma</a>. Loansumâ€™s Strata foundation lays the groundwork for providing future
            versions of loansum that include sophisticated market risk analytics by projecting future bank loan cash
            flows and evaluating credit spread and interest rate scenarios.
