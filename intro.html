            Native bank loan software is notoriously complex and expensive. Only a handful of software vendors model
            loans accurately with sufficient support to produce detailed cash flows with accompanying explanations.
            Loansum was developed to establish a free and open source loan software library around which a community of
            stakeholders would evolve to continuously extend and improve the software over time. Loansum is released as
            Open Source Software under the <a

            versions of loansum that include sophisticated market risk analytics by projecting future bank loan cash
            flows and evaluating credit spread and interest rate scenarios.
