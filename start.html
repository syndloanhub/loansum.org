            The best way to become acquainted with loansum functionality is to play with the calculator application by
            clicking on <i>Calculator</i>. The calculator contains a variety of example loans that may be selected in
            order to examine loan data and generate cash flows with accompanying explains. Loans may be edited to
            observe the effect of changes and new loans and trades may also be created. A set of short videos which
            demonstrate the basic usage of the calculator application may be accessed by clicking on <i>Demos</i>.

                This dependency on the loansum-pricer module will provide access to all of loansum's cash flow
                functionality. Loansum is also released to GitHub through the standard <a
                    href="https://github.com/syndloanhub/loansum/releases"
                    target="_blank">repository release pages</a>. Source code can be obtained directly from <a
                    href="https://github.com/syndloanhub/loansum"
                    target="_blank">GitHub</a>. To do this you will need <a
                    href="https://git-scm.com/download/"
                    target="_blank">Git</a>. Simply clone the repository locally:

git clone https://github.com/syndloanhub/loansum.git

                Finally, since loansum extends Strata, the OpenGamma <a

                    target="_blank">Strata</a> site contains a great deal of relevent and useful documentation as well
                which we do not attempt to replicate here.

                The best source of example code is the <i>loansum-pricer</i> module unit test code. This code is
                located in the source file <i>ProratedLoanTradePricerTest.java</i>. The unit test code demonstrates how to construct
                loan and associated trade objects, generate prorated versions of these objects, and use pricer instances
                to calculate cash flows, accompanying explains, and present value.
